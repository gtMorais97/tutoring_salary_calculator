# tutoring_salary_calculator

I have been tutoring programming students for a while and so decided to use the google calendar api to calculate how much money I have earned from this side job between two dates. The script also tells me what proportion of time I spent with each student in a nice little pie chart. 


How to run:


1.go to the explicacoes dir \n


2.run ```python3 monings_calculator.py start_date end_date price_per_hour``` with dd/mm/yyyy format and price_per_hour should be a number (duh).
